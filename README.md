# hello-world
Hi! This are my first steps on GitHub. Here my adventure begins!

My name is Morena and I have been learning to code for a while, but I never took it seriously until now. I have been studying web development at Platzi, a great platform with amazing people; and next month I will start a software engineering career at the university. Welcome to my journey!
